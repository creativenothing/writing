- when i was first radicalized, i found it difficult to have discussions with other non-radicalized people because there had been a fundamental shift in underlying assumptions that made it impossible for others to see the pieces

yes i definitely shared this experience but more prominently from the other side, where the ideas of anarchism didn't make sense to me until repeated exposure. but i've also experienced other radical shifts in my worldview where i've experienced this phenomenon; for example going from thinking that gender behavior was entirely a social construct to thinking it is the result of evolutionary strategies; from tabula rasa to innate preparedness to experience the world; even now, from enlightenment empiricist to perceiving the world in terms of power relations. i consider myself very familiar with the experience of it being difficult to communicate across world views. in fact, i have the same experience discussing materialism with you! you called it a 'shift' which makes me think of the way thomas kuhn talks about paradigm shifts in science; it's not incremental change that adds up or breaks down, but it's an entire shift of the foundation that makes everything built upon it entirely different than what came before, and makes translation difficult. this is why arrogance in communication frustrates me.

- The number 3 (and other 'forms') is infinite whereas the physical world grows and decays
  - they are realer than real
  - it feels like numbers are just ideas in our head, but if we just 'make them up' then why do they map onto the world in ways that allow us to do things like launch objects into space?
  - A strict Darwinian understanding would posit that we are only here to survive, but this would indicate that there would be no reason for our understanding to map onto reality at all.
    - a 'funhouse understanding'
  - "How is it that these things seem to be written into the universe?"
  - It seems like we have "ESP" in that we have insight into a universe we shouldn't be able to see into

i think one starting point we can agree upon is that *something* exists that is real. i also believe that we are experiencing that reality. it seems like where we differ is that you think that our experience of the reality of the universe comes from some inner 'god' capacity, whereas i think it comes from the nature of our bodies, which, being part of the world, touch and are touched by the world as they move though it and thus have insight into the universe (which includes ourselves, obviously). because i think our bodies are a small part of the universe our capacity to understand the infinite is limited, but this doesn't mean it has no connection to reality. it is a simplified representation that nonetheless maps on in systematic ways. given that our representation of the universe is simplified it can be 'incorrect' in the way that a shadow on the wall that looks like a circle could be of a sphere or a cylinder, but it's not arbitrary; there is a logical relationship between the representation we experience and the infinity it represents.

and so, i am not following this claim that we just 'make up' numbers in a way that is divorced from what numbers really are. i am especially not following the claim that a strict Darwiniam claim would imply that our experience would have no need to map onto our reality. the whole pont of a darwiniam claim is that our bodies would be adapted to reality in a way that enables survival; to use a cheap example, if i had a funhouse concept of 'three' and interpreted a thousand enemies as three and decided to attack them, or three berries as a thousand and risked my life for them, i probably wouldn't get very far.

but to try to get at this 'realer than real' idea--i think that to the extent that humans throughout time have perceived 'three-ness' beacuse it is something real about the universe (something i agree with!) then it is the same 'three' then and now. however, if there were nothing perceiving the three-ness then the three-ness would just be part of the infinity of the universe with no-one to ascribe 'three-ness' to it.

- the transcendental argument: in orger to philosophise you have to presuppose categories of true/false, and by entering into this you make an ethical claim that someone should accept your claims

the ethics claim seems to presuppose that one is obligated to seek true things and reject false ones, a presupposition i don't make. but i do agree that if one attempts to philosophise in any coherent way they are presupposing that there is something they are philosophising about and there is an extent the philosophy can be said to accurately represent that thing (this is what i want to be willing to call 'true' but i think you might mean something else)

- there is a metaphysical sense that there must be such a thing as forms
- the Absolute is beyond being; being emanates from it in a layered, hierarchical way; it proceeds from unity to multiplicity
- forms are at a higher layer, reality isn't just horizontal, there is a verticality
- the 'great chain of being'
- Forms are the building blocks of reality; they are above us in the chain and what's down here is just reflection. just as seeing yourself in the mirror, the reflection is real but not as real as you

i suppose i would be willing to say that there must be such a thing that we are a simplified version of. i am curious about what you perceive to be the nature of these layers and this hierarchy. I think of it as dimensionality; you mentioned horizontality and verticality but there could potentially be infinite dimensions of increasing complexity, each logically related to the next, each lower layer a simplified representation of a higher layer, etc.
